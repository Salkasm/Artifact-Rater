Hello and welcome!

To run this bot you will need a few things. First thing, install the required dependencies (you can view them in the package.json file). Notibly it requires discord.js (as this is a Discord bot) and ocr-space-api-wrapper (which is an external free program that will perform the OCR readings).
I have provided a generic config.json file (make sure to rename it to that) where you can add in the 2 required tokens and any desired prefix for the bot.
The OCR API key is free and requires a sign-up. It will only ask for your e-mail to send the key (https://ocr.space/OCRAPI).
The Discord token requires you to generate one in your dev settings (https://discord.com/developers/applications).

Bots current version is 1.0.
